## Endpoints

### LLM (Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct)

Endpoint : http://localhost:8080/ai-assistant/ask

Body :

```text
'{"question": "Please write a Rust sample program"}'"}'
```

Response example :

```text
üõ†Ô∏è Hello there! I'm here to assist you with your programming needs! To write a simple Rust program, you can use the following code:

\```rust
// Greetings in Rust ü¶Ä
fn main() {
    println!("üåç Hello, World!");
}
\```

To run this code, you will need to have Rust and its package manager, `cargo`, installed on your machine. You can follow
the installation instructions on the Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

To create a new project and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
2. Run the command `cargo new my_project` to create a new project called "my_project". This will create a new folder
   with the same name.
3. Navigate to the new project folder by running `cd my_project`.
4. Replace the contents of the `src/main.rs` file with the code above.
5. Run the program by typing `cargo run` in the terminal.

You should see the message "üåç Hello, World!" printed to the console.

Happy coding! ü§ì

```
